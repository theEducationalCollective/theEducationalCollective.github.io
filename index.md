# Open Source/Open Access Learning Materials and Presentations

This is the website for the Educational Collective, a Github organization created for sharing **educational materials** and **materials about education** (mostly the former). The site focuses on using coding and computing to teach various topics. Most of the materials are from presentations and workshops and contain the slides, any handouts or worksheets, and code files.

Regular Github users see below for more on the repos/forking/etc....

## Instructions For Most People

Most of you are probably here to get the **Southeastern Psychological Association (SEPA) R and Statistics Workshops** from the annual meetings. The delivered versions of the workshops are available as individual zip file downloads from [our repositiory](https://osf.io/hnq32/) on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). Each of these links will start the download of the zip file of the named workshop:

+ 2019: [Graphics in R Using ggplot2](https://osf.io/8gvey/download)
+ 2018: [Introduction to R](https://osf.io/ehwxv/download)
+ 2018: [Introduction to the Bootstrap in R for Psychology](https://osf.io/pkbre/download)
+ 2019: [Linear Models in R](https://osf.io/fs9na/download)

All of the workshops, along with any updates made to them since the original presentation, are in a [single repo](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective/SEPA-Annual-Workshops) and if you want to use that, see the instructions below "For Github Users."

## For Github Users

To access the collection of repos (repositories; individual projects, for those of you who do not use Github regularly) you can click on the "[View My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective)" link to the left or the highlighted text. There you will find one repo per project, and inside of each repo are all of the shared materials. From your Github account, feel free to fork or clone the repos that interest you, and don't forget to send pull requests for any great improvements you add. 

### The SEPA Workshop Repo

If you specifically want the older versions of the SEPA workshops, see the [SEPA Annual Workshops Repo](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective/SEPA-Annual-Workshops). This repo contains **all** of the workshops presented at SEPA in a single place, not just the most recent version or year. These versions also incorporate any minor updates and fixes discovered since presentation. The individual links above will be kept up to date, but, if you absolutely want the latest stuff, you will have to sign up for Github and clone the repo. (Most people do **not** need this!)

If you just want the **code and materials** from all of the workshops, but don't want to sign up for Github, each repo has a large green "Clone or Download" button for getting copies of the files to your own computer. Just click the button and select "Download Zip." (You will get some extra junk Github uses for tracking the history of the projects, but it is not too excessive. But there will be some invisible files and folders and these will take up a few MB of space.)
