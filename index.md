# Open Source/Open Access Learning Materials and Presentations

This is the website for the Educational Collective, a Github organization created for sharing **educational materials** and **materials about education** (mostly the former). The site focuses on using coding and computing to teach various topics. Most of the materials are from presentations and workshops and contain the presentations, any handouts or worksheets, and code files.

Regular Github users see below for more on the repos/forking/etc....

## Instructions For Most People

Most of you are probably here to get the **Southeastern Psychological Association (SEPA) R and Statistics Workshops** from the annual meetings. The delivered versions of the workshops are available as individual zip file downloads from [our repositiory](https://osf.io/hnq32/) on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/). Each of these links will start the download of the zip file of the named workshop:

+ 2019: [Graphics in R Using ggplot2](https://osf.io/8gvey/download)
+ 2018: [Introduction to R](https://osf.io/ehwxv/download)
+ 2018: [Introduction to the Bootstrap in R for Psychology](https://osf.io/pkbre/download)
+ 2019: [Linear Models in R](https://osf.io/fs9na/download)

All of the workshops, along with any updates made to them since the original presentation, are in a [single repo](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective/SEPA-Annual-Workshops) and if you want to use that, see the instructions below "for Github users."

## For Github Users

To access the collection of repos (individual projects, for those of you who do not use Github regularly) you can click on the "[View My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective)" link to the left or the highlighted text. There you will find one repo per project, and inside of each repo are all of the shared materials. From your Github account, feel free to fork or clone the repos that interest you, and don't forget to send pull requests for any great improvements you add. If you just want the code, each repo has a large green "Clone or Download" button for getting copies of the files to your own computer. Just click the button and select "Download Zip." This will download the materials for workshop/tutorial and also the Github history of the project.

### SEPA Workshop Repo

If you want the older workshops, see the repo. If you want the absolutely latest edits of the workshops, see the repo. The links above will be kept up to date as best as we can, but if you want the bleeding edge, clone the repo following the instructions above. If you don't want to sign up for Github, all of the repo can be downloaded as a single zip file following the instructions above.
