# Open Source/Open Access Learning Materials and Presentations

This is the website for the Educational Collective, a Github organization created for sharing **educational materials** and **materials about education**.

## For Github Users

To access the collection of repos (individual projects, for those of you who do not use Github regularly) you can click on the "[View My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective)" link to the left or the highlighted text. There you will find one repo per project, and inside of each repo are all of the shared materials. From your Github account, feel free to fork the repos that interest you, and don't forget to send pull requests for any great improvements you add. If you just want the code, each repo has a large green "Clone or Download" button for getting copies of the files to your own computer. Just click the button and select "Download Zip."

## For Everyone Else

Most of you are probably here to get the **Southeastern Psychological Association (SEPA) Workshops** from the annual meetings. All of the workshops, along with any updates made to them since the original presentation, are in this [single repo](https://github.com/theEducationalCollective/SEPA-Annual-Workshops) and can be downloaded as a single zip file following the instructions above. Note that when you download from Github, there is extra stuff included in hidden folders. It is not huge, but if your disk is full read on...

If you want a specific workshop and nothing else, or want to avoid the extra Github data, then you can download the specific workshops from [our repositiory](https://osf.io/hnq32/) on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) from these links:

+ 2019: [Graphics in R Using ggplot2](https://osf.io/8gvey/download)
+ 2018: [Introduction to R](https://osf.io/ehwxv/download)
+ 2018: [Introduction to the Bootstrap in R for Psychology](https://osf.io/pkbre/download)
+ 2019: [Linear Models in R](https://osf.io/fs9na/download)

If you want the older workshops, see the repo referred to above. These links and files will be kept up to date as best as we can, but if you want the bleeding edge, clone the repo following the instructions above.
